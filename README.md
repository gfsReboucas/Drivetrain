# Drivetrain

This repo contains a step-by-step procedure to down-scale drivetrains while keeping their structural integrity and frequency distribution inaltered.
To achieve that, multi-stage geared drivetrains are modelled according to ISO-IEC standards. 

The code can be used to model spur and helical parallel and planetary gearboxes, while shafts and bearings are represented in a simplified way.
The code is developed in MATLAB and can be integrated with third party softwares [Simpack](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/simpack/) and [KISSsoft](https://www.kisssoft.com/en) via a COM interface.
